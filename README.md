My personal notes ...

One of my major accomplishments this year was the completion of the Airflow 2 migration for inbound and outbound DAGs. This was a complex project that required a lot of planning and coordination, and I am pleased with the successful outcome. The migration has improved the efficiency and reliability of our systems, and I am proud to have played a key role in its completion.

Another achievement I am proud of is the successful completion of the Trex August failover activities. Ensuring the smooth operation of our systems is crucial to our success, and I am glad that I was able to contribute to this effort.

I also made significant progress on the SBC CFF for NPI and NON-NPI file processing. This project involved delivering files through onestream, which was a new technology for our team. I took the initiative to set up the necessary infrastructure and prepared a documentation on onestream to help others in the team understand how to use it. I am pleased that everything went smoothly and that I was able to support the efficient delivery of files through onestream. In order to support this process, I also added a new IAM role to the S3 bucket policy, which has helped to improve the efficiency of our file processing.

I have also been working on updating marketing offers bogie files and completing the grayhair direct mail marketing inbound file processing. Both of these projects required close collaboration with team contacts and stakeholders, and I am proud of the successful outcomes.

Another important achievement this year was the fixing of several vulnerabilities in the CX flow. Maintaining the security and integrity of our systems is essential, and I am glad that I was able to contribute to this effort.

In addition to these projects, I am proud to have written comprehensive documentation for every project I worked on this year. Documenting my work has helped to ensure that my projects are understood and can be easily referenced by others in the future.

I am also pleased to have prepared a document that lists our datasets of incoming and outgoing files. This document includes important information such as the DAG, exchange dataset name, NPI or NON-NPI status of the file, dataset name, owner, and schedule. This is a valuable resource for our file inventory, and I am glad to have contributed to its creation.

Another accomplishment this year was the development of three VSCode extensions. The first extension allows users to trigger and monitor DAGs within VSCode, the second extension helps to manage AWS credentials, and the third extension enables users to browse the team artifactory. I am proud to have developed these useful tools, which have helped to improve the efficiency and productivity of our team.

Finally, I am pleased to have completed the automations for the BJs outbound DAG. This will help streamline our processes and improve our efficiency, and I am glad to have played a role in this project.

Overall, I feel that I have made significant contributions to our team this year, and I am looking forward to continuing to work hard and contribute to the success of the company in the future.
