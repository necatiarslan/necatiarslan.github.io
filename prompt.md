Role: Act as a Senior Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer specializing in modern, high-performance personal portfolios.

Objective: Create the code for a professional, single-page personal website for Necati Arslan. The site will be hosted on GitHub Pages (github.io).

Theme & Aesthetic:

Style: Modern, minimalist, and "Engineered."

Color Palette: Deep Dark Theme (Rich blacks, slate grays, with accent colors like AWS Orange or Cyber Blue).

Vibe: Data-driven, cloud-native, and open-source focused. Use clean typography (Inter or JetBrains Mono).

Tech Stack:

React (using Tailwind CSS for styling).

Lucide-react for iconography.

Framer Motion for subtle scroll animations.

Implementation: Provide the solution as a single-file React component that can be easily integrated into a Vite/Next.js project, or a high-quality HTML/Tailwind CDN file for immediate deployment.

Content Strategy & Sections:

Hero Section: High-impact headline focusing on "Data Architecture, AWS Cloud, and Open Source Contribution." Include a professional summary based on my profile.

Expertise Grid: Focus on AWS (Cloud Architecture), Data Engineering (Big Data, ETL, Databases), and Open Source Development.

Open Source & GitHub: A dedicated section highlighting my work on GitHub. Include a "Sponsor Me" call-to-action that links to my GitHub Sponsors page.

Projects Gallery: Create placeholders for my top repositories. Use cards that display repository names, tech tags, and "View on GitHub" buttons.

Professional Links: Integrated links to:

GitHub: https://github.com/necatiarslan

LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/necati-arslan/

GitHub Sponsors: https://github.com/sponsors/necatiarslan

Footer: Simple, clean, with a "Built with Open Source" badge.

Specific Instructions:

Use my provided links to infer my skill set (Data, AWS, Python, etc.).

Ensure the layout is fully responsive (mobile-friendly).

Use glassmorphism effects for cards.

Crucial: Since I am a GitHub Sponsor recipient, make the "Sponsorship" section feel integrated and prestigious, not like a secondary thought.

Deliverable: Please provide the complete, production-ready code. If using React, include the necessary Tailwind configuration.
